WIP: Verify coldcard dice rolls

# Hardware:
  - Raspberry Pi 3B
  - Waveshare 1.3" oled SH1106
 
# Interface:
## Main Menu: 
  - Use up and down hat to navigate main menu and press hat to select, only working option is the `Verify Rolls` currently
## Verify Rolls:
  - Use up and down to move roll value from 1-6, click in the hat to confirm number or press Key 1, this will update the SHA and seed words
  - Use left or right on the hat to navigate seed words 1-24
  - Press key3 to go back to main menu

- still a bunch of hanging interfaces, only supports SH1106 display, just trying to make something that works with the parts I have now.
